| **Brute-force attacks** | Automated guessing of passwords |
| **IP Spoofing** | Faking an IP address to gain access |
| **Keylogging** | Capturing keystrokes to steal credentials |

✅ Avoid unknown links/emails ✅ Use firewalls ✅ Enable endpoint security

---

## 🔑 Password Security

### **Best Practices:**
✅ Use a **password manager**  
✅ Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)**  
✅ Avoid reusing passwords  
✅ Generate **long & complex passwords** (e.g., 12+ characters, mix of symbols, numbers, and cases)

### **Attack Types:**
- **Brute-force attack** → Tries all possible passwords
- **Dictionary attack** → Uses a list of common passwords
- **Rainbow table attack** → Precomputed hashes to crack stored passwords

---

## 🔐 Encryption & Data Security

### **Definition:**
Encryption converts data into unreadable formats to prevent unauthorized access.

### **Types:**
| **Encryption Method** | **Usage** |
|------------------|------------|
| **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** | Secure file & disk encryption |
| **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)** | Secure online transactions |
| **TLS/SSL** | Encrypts web traffic (HTTPS) |

✅ Encrypt sensitive files ✅ Use secure connections (HTTPS) ✅ Store passwords securely

---

## 🌍 Network Security Basics

| **Concept** | **Description** |
|------------|---------------|
| **Firewall** | Blocks unauthorized network traffic |
| **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** | Encrypts internet connections for privacy |
| **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** | Monitors network for suspicious activities |
| **MAC Address** | Unique hardware identifier for network devices |
| **Network Interface Card (NIC)** | Connects a computer to a network |

✅ Use a firewall ✅ Enable VPN when using public Wi-Fi ✅ Regularly update security settings

---

## 🏗️ OSI Model & Network Topologies

| **OSI Layer** | **Function** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Physical** | Transfers raw data (bits) over hardware |
| **Data Link** | Manages reliable data transfer between devices |
| **Network** | Routes data packets (IP addresses) |
| **Transport** | Ensures error-free end-to-end communication |
| **Session** | Maintains connections between systems |
| **Presentation** | Handles encryption & data formatting |
| **Application** | Manages user interface & communication (HTTP, SMTP, etc.) |

### **Network Topologies:**
| **Topology** | **Description** |
|------------|---------------|
| **Bus** | All devices share a single backbone cable |
| **Star** | All devices connect to a central hub/switch |
| **Ring** | Devices form a closed-loop for data transmission |
| **Mesh** | Devices interconnect for redundancy |

✅ Choose topology based on network requirements ✅ Secure network infrastructure ✅ Monitor traffic for threats
